# Image-Processing
WinForms Image Processing application
Creates image histograms original image adn new image after performing basic image manipulation opperations. Focuses mainly on
color manipulation and applaying some filters. Has a pixel sorting by some pixel attribute (hue, saturation and brightness) feature 
which requires some attention becouse sorting changes the historam and that shouldn't happen. Plan on changing the consrtruction of
a histgram from just a PictureBox with some lines on it to a Chart with 3 histogram: one for red, one for green and one for blue
values of pixels. Other possible additions inclue: creation of a new control for color manipulation - a color disc (like a color 
picker), edge detection (Sobel),thresholding and other basic image processing opperations. First WinForms application I made so 
requires a lot of attention and can be greatly improved.
