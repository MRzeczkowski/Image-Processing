# Image-Processing
WinForms Image Processing application
Creates image histograms and performs basic image manipulation opperations. Focuses mainly on color manipulation and applaying some
filters. Has a pixel sorting by some pixel attribute (hue, saturation and brightness) feature which requires some attention becouse 
sorting changes the historam and that shouldn't happen. Plan on changing the consrtruction of a histgram from just a PictureBox 
with some lines on it to a Chart with 3 histogram: one for red, one for green and one for blue values of pixels. Other possible
additions inclue: creation of a new control for color manipulation - a color disc (like a color picker), edge detection (Sobel),
thresholding and other basic image processing opperations.
